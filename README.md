# fhsucalendar
My implementation of calendar.fhsu.edu

To run locally:
You need npm installed. Once the project is cloned or downloaded, run "npm install" in your terminal/command line/powershell/etc to install dependencies. From there, run either "npm start" or "npm run build". NPM start will start a server instance than you can access on your web browser at localhost:8080. If you make a change in the src folder, the page in the browser will update automatically, no refresh needed! This is the developer command. If you run "npm run build" a dist folder will be generated. This is the compiled output of the project. This is just a static html page.
